# TxtElite - LUA version
Text Elite is a C implementation of the classic Elite trading system, written by Ian Bell himself, one of the two original authors of Elite. Check [Ian Bell website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/text/index.htm) for more info.

It's not a real game, since there is no real challenge, and you can add cash as you wish.

I used the "cleaned" C source code by [richcarl](https://github.com/richcarl/txtelite), who also wrote an Erlang version.
